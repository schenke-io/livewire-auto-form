Stop manually mapping every Eloquent attribute to a Livewire property and start focusing on your app's core logic with our buffer-based form management.

**If you struggle with the following problems, we are just for you:**

*   **Tedious property definitions:** Tired of manually adding `public string $name` for every model attribute? Our single-buffer architecture handles it all.
*   **"Forgot-to-save" bugs:** Eliminate accidental data loss with centralized state management and predictable auto-save logic.
*   **Relationship boilerplate:** Editing child models shouldn't be hard. Handle relationships with simple method calls and zero extra code.
*   **Manual option lists:** Stop hardcoding select options. Use `AutoFormOptions` to centralize labels in your Models and Enums, or rely on our smart automatic generation.
*   **Rigid workflows:** Switch between real-time "auto-save" and traditional "Save" buttons effortlessly, without rewriting your component.
*   **Complex Wizard Workflows:** Building multi-step forms usually requires manual state management for steps. Our Wizard support automates navigation and validation.
*   **Complex testing:** Logic consistency means fewer edge cases and easier unit testing for your form components.
